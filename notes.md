## File corruption, what now?
Hi! you might remember this project a little differently, and there is a reason for that. originally, i was permanently storing all the iterations of this on a USB stick, and editing on there as well. the outcome of this was that around half of my files were turned into this:
```
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
```
that's Not Great™! i learned my lesson and moved to working on a hard drive, but what sucks is everything i made up to this point is completely gone. 

Oh well, time to start again!

## Changes in this version
---
- Everything!
---
That's right, everything must go (and already kinda has.) in favour of a more planned out approach. the last version of this awas alright for learning what i was doing but it was very unoptimized and poorly planned. 

for an actual list of changes i'm making, see below. 

---
- changed form composition
    - technically Form1 (required presense, also does save + load, holds all data)
    - Viewport form (visuals and mouse+keyboard control only)
    - Controls form (textbox controls + settings)
    - Scenes form (merge of the Scene info form and the Manage scenes form)
- No longer an MDI form structure
    - standalone windows!
- New rendering modes, **Solid**
    - made of tris
    - shaded
    - implemented depth buffer
    - implemented Back culling
    - can shade based on: 
        - Depth
        - Screen-space normals
        - world-space normals
        - Directional Lighting
- Double buffering (was also in previous version but the ***ÿÿÿ*** got to it)
- function placement that actually makes sense
    - moved keyboard+mouse handling to the only window that uses it
    - all forms are opened from Form1, Form1 now has UI other than the menu items
    - all functions to update are called by Form1, avoiding the messy *WithEvents* variables (still need them in some places)

---

And the big addition(s) of this version: 

## Live Scene Editing
- accessed through the Scenes form
- manually edit scenes with visual feedback
```
(NOTE: the second you activate this, all world-space transforms are temporarily set to 0)
(also note: this doesn't apply to camera transforms)
(controlled by shift+click+drag, cycle through points with ctrl+right and left click)
(mouse+keyboard camera controls are allowed)
```
---

## Solid Rendering
- Please help, i'm dreaming of vector math
- Dot product my beloved
---

Sadly, both with losing the old versions and adding a new rendering mode, the number of objects in this is far less than before. I'll try to change that but i'll work on the core functionality before i try adding more objects

---
## TODO
- mouse input
- scene manager
- save + load system
