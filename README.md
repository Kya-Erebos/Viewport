# Viewport
#### A 3d renderer made in Visual Basic
## File corruption, what now?
Hi! you might remember this project a little differently, and there is a reason for that. originally, i was permanently storing all the iterations of this on a USB stick, and editing on there as well. the outcome of this was that around half of my files were turned into this:
```

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

Not great! i learned my lesson and moved to working on my device, but what sucks is everything i made up to this point is completely gone. 

Oh well, time to start again!

## Changes in this version
---
- Everything!
---
That's right, everything must go (and already kinda has), in favour of a more planned out approach. the last version of this was alright for learning what i was doing but it was very unoptimized and poorly planned. 

Here's a list of actual changes

---
- change of goals
    - Rather than being a front-end application, i'm focusing on making a useable backend, and as such i've remmoving a lot of the purely UX stuff. 
- Changed form composition
    - currently the only functional form is the viewport form. this may become the only form, still unsure
- New solid renderring mode
    - this is NOT the final form, still some edge cases i need to work out. you can see me starting to work on the code for the next iteration as well. 
- Object oriented approach
    - two categories, the Layers and the Objects. Objects hold data and do the transforms, layers are what render things to the screen. 
---

Sadly, both with losing the old versions and adding a new rendering mode, the number of objects in this is far less than before. I'll try to change that but i'll work on the core functionality before i try adding more objects

---

# TODO
- new(er) rendering layer
- optimisations
